# Phaser / JS Games

This is just some learning / testing I'm doing with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/).

Test1 = first attempt to make a space shooter / dodger "asteroid style", but I had a lot of trouble with the ship collision box.

Test2 = making your first game => [Phaser official tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1).

Test3 = second attempt for my space asteroid-ish game with Matter.js physic. I'm still in learning mode so most of the code comes from my first attempt.
